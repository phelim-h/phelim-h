## About Me

I am a Computer Science student, also studying maths. Looking to develop my career into Computer Science.

## Languages & other bits

 - Java
 - Python
 - SQL (MySQL)
 - Git / Github

I am keen to learn other langauges and technologies so I can explore as much of the CS as I can!

## Projects

I am currently working on an Internet Visualiser that simulates the TCP/IP stack and related functions necessary for network
communication - while being on the local machine. I am hoping that this project provides som complexity to advance my knowledge on
networking. This repository is not currently public as it is part of my coursework, after the completion of the coursework I plan
to release it and keep working with it.
